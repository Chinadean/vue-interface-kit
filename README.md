# What is it?
It's an interface kit for cms. After creating this kit, we can take decisions faster than old ones.

# Why I created a kit?
We developed this structure because improve performance on css side and be faster about implementation problems. In all designs have same structures but every section change ownself after revisions. These problems was creating new issues for front-end developers.

# Benefits
1. All projects will use same buttons/inputs and grid structures in this way we don't live any confused about the projects.
2. All components working on one class and these classes have a prefix. We create t- prefix for this purpose. (t-fields, t-buttons, t-cards, t-'......')
3. Advanced color palette

# Dependencies

2. Multiselect ([https://vue-multiselect.js.org])
3. VCalendar ([https://vcalendar.io])
